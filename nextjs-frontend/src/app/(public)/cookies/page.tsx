      <h2>Cookies in this release</h2>
      <p>
        This release is intended to set no non-essential cookies and run no analytics, advertising
        or tracking scripts. Browsing the public pages is not meant to store anything on your
        device, so no cookie banner is shown at present. That is our current reading and it is still
        to be confirmed in review.
      </p>
      <h2>If you sign in</h2>
      <p>
        If you sign in to an account, a sign-in cookie keeps you signed in for up to five days. It
        is needed for the sign-in you asked for and is not used for anything else. Signing in may
        also make your browser keep sign-in state for the same reason. The final list will name each
        item.
      </p>
      <h2>If that changes</h2>
      <p>
        If analytics or other optional cookies are added later, this page will list each one, what
        it is for and how long it lasts, and we will ask for your consent before setting it unless a
        legal exception clearly applies and we say so.
