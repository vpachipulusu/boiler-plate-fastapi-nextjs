      <h2>What this release collects</h2>
      <p>
        If you sign up for alerts we collect the email address you enter, the categories and how
        often you want to hear from us, and a record of your agreement: the exact wording you saw,
        when you agreed and which form you used. We do not store your IP address in that record. The
        contact form is switched off. Accounts are different: see the next section.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like any website, the service that hosts Freejoy handles technical details of each request,
        such as your IP address and browser type, to deliver pages and keep the site secure. If
        error reporting is switched on, details of a fault, and a small sample of page-load timing
        reports, which include the page address and browser details, may be sent to our
        error-monitoring provider. Who these providers are and how long they keep the details will
        be added here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The email address you give for alerts is sent to us in the body of a request, never in the
        page address. The links in our emails do carry a single-use code in the page address, so
        that code can appear in request logs of our host; it stops working once it has been used.
        Error reports sent to our error-monitoring provider have that code removed first.
      </p>
      <h2>If you create an account</h2>
      <p>
        If you create an account, we hold your email address, your name if you give one, the times
        you sign in, and the IP address and browser of each sign-in. If you switch on two-factor
        sign-in, we also hold those settings. How long each of these is kept will be added here.
      </p>
      <h2>Email alerts</h2>
      <p>
        We use a double opt-in. After you submit the alerts form we email you a confirmation link,
        and you are added to the alert list only when you open it and press the button. The link
        works for {CONFIRM_WINDOW_TEXT} and once. Until then we send nothing else. We keep the details above so
        that we can send the alerts you asked for and show that you asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every alert email carries an unsubscribe link, and mail apps that offer a one-click
        unsubscribe button can use it. Proposed retention, for legal review: a sign-up that is never
        confirmed is deleted after 30 days. If you unsubscribe, we keep your address on a
        do-not-email list for 12 months, only so that it is not emailed again, and then delete it.
        Subscribers who stay subscribed are kept until they unsubscribe.
      </p>
      <p>
        We plan to use an email provider to send these emails and hold the alert list. The provider
        currently proposed is Brevo, which hosts its data in the EU. This is not yet confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When real offers go live, we plan to count how many times each offer&apos;s button is used.
        The plan is to record which offer and when, without your IP address, a cookie identifier or
        an account identifier. This is a plan, not something running today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Details of who processes this data, how long it is kept and how to ask for it to be removed
        will be added here.
      </p>
      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        Under UK data protection law you have rights to access, correct and delete your personal
        information, to object to direct marketing and, where we rely on your consent, to withdraw
        it. You can also complain to the Information Commissioner&apos;s Office. The final wording
        and a contact route will be added after review.
