      <h2>What Freejoy is</h2>
      <p>
        Freejoy is planned to list free samples, free trials, cashback, vouchers and competitions
        from brands people in the UK might enjoy, with the terms in plain words next to each one. We
        do not run the offers; the brand does.
      </p>
      <h2>Not everything is free</h2>
      <p>
        Each listing says which kind of offer it is. A free sample may have postage to pay. A free
        trial may ask for a card and start charging when it ends. Cashback and vouchers are not
        free: you spend money first or get a discount. A competition is an entry, not a prize.
      </p>
      <h2>How we intend to check offers</h2>
      <p>
        The plan: an editor reads the brand&apos;s own page and notes the offer type, any postage,
        whether a card is needed and who can claim. This release is a design preview with sample
        listings, so no offer shown here has been through that process yet. Offers change without
        notice, so always read the brand&apos;s terms before you claim.

        ))}
      </ol>
      <h2>How Freejoy plans to pay for itself</h2>
      <p>
        Some links to brands are expected to earn Freejoy a commission once real offers go live.
        Read the <Link href="/affiliate-disclosure">affiliate disclosure</Link> for how that is
        planned to work.

      <h2>Keeping in touch</h2>
      <p>
        Alerts are a preview for now: you can try the <Link href="/alerts">alerts form</Link>, but
        it does not save anything yet. The <Link href="/contact">contact page</Link> will explain
        how to tell us about a problem with a listing once it is live.
