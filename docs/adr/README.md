# Architecture decision records

One record per decision. The code and the developer docs describe *what* exists; these records hold *why*.
Write a new ADR when you change a decision below, instead of editing the old one: mark the old record
"Superseded by ADR-NNN" and keep it for history.

## Index

the template. Start your own records at 012 (or renumber; nothing depends on the numbers).

## Statuses

- **Accepted:** signed off; change only by a new ADR that supersedes it.
