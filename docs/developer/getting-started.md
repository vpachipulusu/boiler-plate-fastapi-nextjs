# Getting started

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | 22.12 or later (22 or 24) | `nextjs-frontend/package.json` declares `engines.node`. |
| npm | 10 or later | npm only. Do not use pnpm or yarn. |
| Python | 3.12 | Required by `fastapi_backend/pyproject.toml` (`>=3.12,<3.13`). |
| uv | current (CI uses 0.8.12) | Manages the backend environment and dependencies. |
| Docker | current | For Postgres (and optionally the whole stack) through `docker-compose.yml`. A local Postgres 16 works too. |
| Firebase project | | Authentication with Email/Password (and Google if you want it) enabled; a service account key for the Admin SDK. |

## Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
```

Two apps: `nextjs-frontend/` and `fastapi_backend/`. Each has its own setup below.

## Database

```bash
docker compose up -d db          # Postgres 16 on localhost:5432, database "yourapp"
docker compose up -d test_db     # optional: a second instance on 5434 for the Postgres-backed backend tests
```

The compose stack uses the fake local credentials from the root `.env.example` (`postgres` / `password`); copy it
to `.env` only to change ports or the compose project name. Without Docker, create a database on your own
Postgres and point `DATABASE_URL` at it.

Most backend tests need no database (they use fake sessions). The `*_e2e.py` tests run only when
`TEST_DATABASE_URL` points at a local database whose name ends in `_test`; see [testing.md](testing.md).

## Backend (`fastapi_backend/`)

```bash
cd fastapi_backend
uv sync
cp .env.example .env             # fill in the Firebase Admin values; set BACKEND_INTERNAL_KEY to any random string
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run fastapi dev app/main.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

`app/core/config.py` reads `.env` from the working directory; every variable is documented in
`fastapi_backend/.env.example`, which is the reference. In short:

| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | asyncpg URL of the platform database. `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` (optional) is used by Alembic when the runtime URL goes through a pooler. |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | No | `local` (default in the example), `test` or `production`. Production enforces the "required outside local/test" rows. |
| `BACKEND_INTERNAL_KEY` | Outside local/test | Shared service key the Next.js server sends as `X-Internal-Key`. `BACKEND_INTERNAL_KEY_NEXT` allows rotation. |
| `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY` | Yes, to sign in | ID token and session cookie verification. |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`, `RATE_LIMIT_EMAIL_KEY` | Outside local/test | Rate limiting (ADR-007). Unset locally: the limiter is disabled. |
| `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | To enable 2FA | Fernet key for TOTP secrets at rest. |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | No | Unset disables Sentry. |
| `APP_NAME`, `LOG_LEVEL` | No | Brand and log level. |
| `STRIPE_*`, `BILLING_RETURN_URL_ORIGINS` | Billing module | See [modules.md](modules.md). |

Check it with `curl http://localhost:8000/health` (`{"status":"ok"}`); `/health/ready` also checks the database and
pending migrations and returns 503 until `alembic upgrade head` has run. `/docs`, `/redoc` and `/openapi.json`
exist only when `ENVIRONMENT` is `local` or `test` (or a Vercel preview); in production they return 404.

`./start.sh` runs the API together with `watcher.py`, which regenerates the OpenAPI file on changes (on Windows,
run it from Git Bash). To regenerate once: `uv run python -m commands.generate_openapi_schema`.

## Frontend (`nextjs-frontend/`)

```bash
cd nextjs-frontend
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local       # fill in the Firebase client and Admin values; BACKEND_INTERNAL_KEY must equal the backend's
npm run typecheck
npm run dev                      # http://localhost:3000
```

`nextjs-frontend/.env.example` documents every variable. The groups:

| Group | Variables | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend | `BACKEND_API_URL`, `BACKEND_INTERNAL_KEY` | Server-only. Locally the FastAPI dev server URL; on Vercel the service binding injects `BACKEND_API_URL`. |
| Firebase client | `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` | Public config from the Firebase console. CI builds with placeholders. |
| Firebase Admin | `FIREBASE_ADMIN_*` | Server-only, session cookie verification. |
| App | `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL`, `LOG_LEVEL` | Brand strings are read by `src/config/site.ts`. |
| Monitoring | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | Optional. |
| Ports | `PORT`, `E2E_PORT`, `BACKEND_PORT` | Optional, for parallel checkouts (below). |
| Stripe Billing module | `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_*` | See [modules.md](modules.md). |
| Capacitor module | `APP_ID`, `APP_NAME` | See [modules.md](modules.md). |

The frontend has no database and no server secrets other than the Firebase Admin credentials and the internal
key: sessions, ID tokens, password changes and plan prices all go through the backend. Stripe return URLs are
built on the server from `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (required in production; Vercel previews fall back to
`https://$VERCEL_URL`, local to `http://localhost:3000`).

`npm run build` needs only the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values (placeholders are fine, as in CI). The `predev` hook runs
`scripts/dev-clean.cjs`; if a stale lock blocks startup, `npm run dev:kill` then `npm run dev`.

## First admin

Admin pages need an admin grant in the backend. The first admin is granted in the database (SQL in
[local-e2e.md](local-e2e.md)); after that an existing admin grants others through
`POST /v1/admin/users/{user_id}/admin` (the Users page in the admin area).

## The whole stack in Docker

```bash
docker compose up                # frontend :3000, backend :8000, Postgres :5432 and :5434, Redis :6379
scripts/compose-smoke.sh all     # what CI runs: health checks, then the degraded case, then down
```

The compose stack uses fake local values and no secrets, so sign-in does not work in it without your Firebase
values in `.env`; it exists to prove the images build and the apps start.

## Pre-commit hooks

```bash
uvx pre-commit install           # once per clone, after both apps are set up
uvx pre-commit run --from-ref origin/main --to-ref HEAD
```

Runs ruff, ruff format and mypy on `fastapi_backend/`, ESLint, Prettier and `tsc --noEmit` on `nextjs-frontend/`,
plus the OpenAPI client and `requirements.txt` sync checks.

## Running in parallel

Two checkouts (for example two git worktrees) can run side by side when each uses its own ports. Defaults are
unchanged; CI and Vercel set none of these.

| Variable | Default | What it moves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `3000` | `npm run dev`, `npm start`, `npm run dev:kill` (kills only the listener on exactly this port) |
| `E2E_PORT` | `3000` | The Playwright-managed server, `baseURL`, and the e2e build (the URL is baked in at build time) |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | `8000` | `fastapi_backend/start.sh`, and the e2e server's `BACKEND_API_URL` (`http://127.0.0.1:$BACKEND_PORT`) |
| `BACKEND_API_URL` | unset | Wins over `BACKEND_PORT` when set explicitly |
| `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, `*_PORT` in root `.env` | `yourapp`, 5432, 5434, 6379, 8000, 3000 | Docker stack: separate containers, volumes and host ports |

```bash
# fastapi_backend/ (terminal 1)
BACKEND_PORT=8100 ./start.sh
# nextjs-frontend/ (terminal 2)
PORT=3100 BACKEND_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8100 npm run dev
# nextjs-frontend/: e2e (the build records its port; a build for another E2E_PORT is refused)
E2E_PORT=3100 BACKEND_PORT=8100 npm run test:e2e:build
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Stuck dev server or `.next/dev/lock` error:** `npm run dev:kill`, then `npm run dev`.
- **`Module not found` after switching package manager:** npm only. Delete `node_modules` and run `npm ci`.
- **`Can't reach database server`:** check `DATABASE_URL`, that Postgres is running, and the port.
- **`/health/ready` returns 503 `migrations_pending`:** run `uv run alembic upgrade head`.
- **`Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-api-key)`:** the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` values must match the Firebase console, and Email/Password sign-in must be enabled there.
- **Sign-in succeeds in Firebase but the app returns to the login page:** `BACKEND_INTERNAL_KEY` differs between the two apps, or the backend's Firebase Admin credentials are for another project.
- **Stripe webhook signature failures locally:** `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/webhooks/stripe` and set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to the secret it prints (billing module only).
