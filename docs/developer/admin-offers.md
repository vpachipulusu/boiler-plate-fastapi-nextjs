# Admin offers UI

The admin screens for the Freejoy catalogue: the freebies list, the offer editor with its publish workflow, and the
categories and merchants pages. They are server-rendered pages and server actions in `nextjs-frontend/` that call
the admin catalogue API ([backend-admin-catalogue.md](backend-admin-catalogue.md)) through wrappers in
`src/lib/api/`. The browser never calls FastAPI, and nothing here decides who may do what: the API checks the
admin's own permission on every call and writes the audit log.

## Routes

| Route | What it is | API permission it needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/admin/offers` | Stats strip, status chips, search, category filter, offers table with a row menu | `offers.read` (row actions: `offers.publish`) |
| `/admin/offers/new` | Offer form; creates a **draft** | `offers.read` to open, `offers.write` to save |
| `/admin/offers/[id]` | Offer form, status actions, affiliate links (read only), card preview | `offers.read`; `offers.write` to save; `offers.publish` for the status actions |
| `/admin/categories`, `/new`, `/[id]` | Table, add form, edit form, enable and disable | `offers.read`; `categories.write` for changes |
| `/admin/merchants`, `/new`, `/[id]` | Table, add form, edit form, activate and deactivate | `offers.read`; `merchants.write` for changes |

The nav (`src/components/admin/admin-nav-items.ts`) lists Freebies, Categories and Merchants straight after
Dashboard. On phones the tab bar shows the first three items (Dashboard, Freebies, Categories); the rest sit behind
More. An admin without a permission still sees the pages; the API answers 403 and the page shows "You do not have
permission to do that". The permission names are the backend's closed `ADMIN_PERMISSIONS`; the frontend holds no copy
of them.

## The list (`/admin/offers`)

* **URL parameters** (`offers-query.ts`): `q` (at most 100 characters), `status` (`published`, `draft`, `expired`,
  `archived`), `category` (an id), `page`. The search and category select are a plain GET form (no script needed),
  like `/admin/users`. The status chips are links; the current one carries `aria-current="page"`. Archived is a fifth
  chip next to the four in the design so an archived offer can be found; the offers there cannot be edited.
* **Stats strip** (`offers-stats.tsx`): Total, Published, Drafts, Expired, Archived. Each status number is the
  `total_count` of a one-row list request to the API (four requests; `fetchOfferStatusCounts`) and Total is their sum,
  so the strip always adds up. Nothing is estimated or cached: if any request fails the strip shows an error (a 429
  says so) and no numbers. The
  design's "Needs review" card has no matching API count and is not shown.
* **Table** (`offers-table.tsx`): Offer (title links to the editor, merchant and type underneath), Category,
  Status (`StatusPill`: good = Published, neutral = Draft, warn = Expired, info = Archived), Verified
  (`formatAdminDate`, or "Not verified"), Edit and a row menu. Below 640px each row stacks and cells name their
  column. Category and merchant names come from the two pick lists (see below).
* **Row menu** (`offer-row-actions.tsx`): Edit, then the steps the status allows: Mark verified, Publish or
  Unpublish, Expire, Archive. The allowed set (`offer-status.ts`) mirrors the backend status table and is only a hint;
  a stale menu gets a 409 from the API and a toast. **Archive asks for confirmation** because there is no way back
  in the admin.

## The publish workflow

1. **Add freebie** creates a `DRAFT` (the API never creates anything else).
2. **Mark verified** sets "last checked" to now (`offers.publish`). Publishing does not do this for you
   (see [backend-admin-catalogue.md](backend-admin-catalogue.md#publish-rules)).
3. **Publish** needs: the category enabled, the merchant active, a source URL or an active affiliate link, no past
   end date, and a verification. If a rule fails the toast lists the unmet rules in fixed wording
   (`admin-catalogue-errors.ts`), for example "This offer cannot be published yet: it has not been verified."
4. **Unpublish** returns it to draft; **Expire** marks a published offer ended; **Archive** is terminal.

**Preview.** A draft has no public page, so the editor shows a card preview drawn from the form as it is typed
(`offer-preview-card.tsx`), labelled "Not public". The link to the live page (`/freebies/<slug>`) appears only when the
status is `PUBLISHED`; it opens in a new tab. Status actions act on the last **saved** version, so while the form beside
them holds unsaved edits they wait (`aria-disabled`, with the reason written out): save first.

**Public pages refresh.** Every status action and a save of a published offer call
`revalidateCatalogue(paths)` (`src/lib/catalogue/revalidate.ts`, from FREEJ-21) with `/freebies` and the offer's own
path; every category or merchant change calls it with `/freebies` only. All of them also call `revalidatePath` for the
admin pages. A failure of that refresh is logged and does not turn a
successful write into an error.

## Server actions

`src/app/actions/admin/offer-actions.ts`, `category-actions.ts`, `merchant-actions.ts`. Each action:

1. runs `asAdmin` (`src/lib/api/admin-catalogue-action.ts`), which calls `requireAdminSession`
   (`src/lib/api/admin-guard.ts`): a verified session cookie and a confirmed admin, exactly as the `/admin` layout
   decides. Anything else returns the curated refusal and **no API call is made**. The proxy cannot do this check;
   every admin page and action does it on the server.
2. validates its input with the same Zod schema the form uses (`src/lib/admin-catalogue/*-schema.ts`, mirrored from
   the API's Pydantic models) and answers with per-field messages (`fieldErrors`) when it fails;
3. checks ids against `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,128}$` before they reach a URL path;
4. calls the wrapper (`admin-offers.ts`, `admin-categories.ts`, `admin-merchants.ts`) and maps a failure to a
   curated message. The result is `{ success: true, data }` or `{ success: false, error, fieldErrors? }`; a taken or
   invalid slug also arrives as a `slug` field error.

On the client, `settleAction` (`src/lib/admin-catalogue/settle-action.ts`) turns a call that throws (network drop,
mid-request deploy) into the same curated failure, so a form or toast always answers.

**Errors never carry backend text.** `callBackend` now also returns the backend's stable `code` (an optional
`code` on the failure result, added for this story); `catalogueErrorMessage` picks the wording from the code
(`slug_taken`, `illegal_transition`, `publish_blocked`, `invalid_url`, ...), then from the status. A refused publish
names its unmet rules only from a fixed table. Unknown codes are ignored. Unexpected failures (5xx, unreachable) are
logged with status and code only.

## Pages check the admin too

The `/admin` layout redirects a non-admin, but layout and page render in parallel, so a page cannot rely on that to
keep it from fetching. Every page under `offers`, `categories` and `merchants` starts with `requireAdminPage()`
(`_lib/require-admin-page.ts`), which asks the same gate as the actions and redirects exactly as the layout does:
`/login` (no session), `/verify-email`, `/api/auth/clear-session` (a session the backend rejected), `/dashboard` (not
an admin). An outage throws, so `error.tsx` renders. It costs two extra backend calls per page view; a unit test per
page proves no wrapper is called after a refusal.

## Forms and accessibility

Forms use react-hook-form with `zodResolver`. Every control has a visible label (`Field`,
`_components/form-field.tsx`); hints and errors are tied to the control with `aria-describedby`, the control gets
`aria-invalid` (and `aria-required` when it is required), and field errors are not also live regions. After a failed submit the first invalid field takes focus (a
server `fieldErrors` entry is set on its field first); a failure that belongs to no field fills a named group ("Could not save") that takes
focus (focused, not also `role="alert"`); a successful save focuses a "Changes saved." status message. While a form has unsaved edits it says "You have unsaved changes." and asks the browser to confirm before the tab is
closed (`beforeunload`). Buttons that start work (the submit button, the row menu, the status buttons, the
enable/disable toggles) use `aria-disabled` while busy rather than `disabled`, so they keep focus and stay announced,
and ignore a second press; a polite status says what is happening. After the archive confirmation focus returns to the
control that started it. Tables are named by their heading. Selects are native `<select>` elements, controls
are at least 44px tall, and the layout is checked at 320, 390 and 1440 px (no horizontal scroll). Dates are entered
in UTC (to the second, so an edit never rounds a stored time) and labelled so.

## Pick lists and limits

(Truncation is shown, not hidden: the filter, the table ("Not in the first 100") and the offer pages each say when a
list holds only the first 100 rows, and the editor always keeps the offer's own category and merchant selectable.)


`_lib/pick-lists.ts` loads categories and merchants once per request (`React.cache`) for the offer form and the
list's names and filter. The API caps a page at 100 rows, so the lists are the first 100; the categories and
merchants pages show a "Showing the first N of M" note if a catalogue ever outgrows that. Disabled categories and
inactive merchants are shown with a suffix so a publish refusal is not a surprise.

Not in this UI (use the API): creating or toggling **affiliate links** (the editor lists them read only),
unarchiving, and optimistic concurrency on edits (a save is last-write-wins, as the API documents).

## Tests

* Unit (Vitest): `src/__tests__/unit/lib/admin-catalogue/` (schemas, status table), `unit/api/admin-catalogue-wrappers.test.ts`
  (URLs, bodies, views, counts), `unit/api/admin-guard-errors.test.ts` (the admin gate and message mapping),
  `unit/actions/admin-catalogue-actions.test.ts` (authorisation failures for every action, validation, refresh),
  `unit/app/admin-offers-list.test.tsx`, `admin-offers-actions-ui.test.tsx`, `admin-offers-form.test.tsx`.
* Backend: `fastapi_backend/tests/test_e2e_identity_server.py` (the journey server's guards).
* Playwright: `src/__tests__/e2e/admin-offers.spec.ts` (Journey 4 and layout checks).

## Journey 4 (Playwright)

Draft, verify, publish, see it on `/freebies/<slug>` and in the search, unpublish, see it gone, archive. It needs a
seeded backend and an admin session; E2E is not part of the `CI gate`, so run it before opening a PR that changes
these screens and record the result.

**With the Firebase test project** (the normal way, see [local-e2e.md](local-e2e.md)): set `TEST_ADMIN_EMAIL` as for
`admin.spec.ts`, point the app at a seeded backend and run

```bash
export E2E_LIVE_CATALOGUE=1 BACKEND_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port> BACKEND_INTERNAL_KEY=<same key>
npm run test:e2e:local -- src/__tests__/e2e/admin-offers.spec.ts
```

**Without Firebase** (a private test database, no sign-in anywhere): start the backend with the test-only identity
server, which serves the real app but accepts exactly two random session values and seeds a matching admin and
non-admin user:

```bash
cd fastapi_backend
export ENVIRONMENT=test DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:<pw>@localhost:<port>/<your_test_db>
export BACKEND_INTERNAL_KEY=<32+ random chars> E2E_ADMIN_SESSION_COOKIE=<24+ random chars> E2E_PLAIN_SESSION_COOKIE=<24+ random chars>
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python -m commands.seed_catalogue
uv run python -m tests.e2e_identity_server --port 8171
```

It refuses to start unless `ENVIRONMENT` is `local` or `test`, the database host is loopback, the database name ends
in `_test` and both values are long and different; it binds to 127.0.0.1; it lives under `tests/` and is never part of the application image: `fastapi_backend/.vercelignore` keeps `tests/`,
`.env*` and caches out of the Vercel bundle (follow-up: the Dockerfile should install with `uv sync --no-dev` too). Then
build and start the app on a production build (never `next dev`) with `BACKEND_API_URL`, `BACKEND_INTERNAL_KEY` and
the same two cookie values, and run Playwright with `E2E_LIVE_CATALOGUE=1 E2E_ADMIN_SESSION_COOKIE=...
E2E_PLAIN_SESSION_COOKIE=...`. The spec puts the value in the `session` cookie.
