# Freejoy user guide

A step-by-step guide to what Freejoy does and how to use it, written for people who are not developers.
Every step has a real screenshot of the app. Pages are plain English; where the app shows a word or label,
the guide uses the same word in **bold**.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-30. The screenshots were taken from the app at commit `5a8851d` on 30 October 2026.

## Please read this first

### The data in the screenshots is sample data

The screenshots were taken from a private test copy of Freejoy running on a computer, not from a live website.

- Every brand in the screenshots is labelled **(Sample)**, for example "Good Beans (Sample)". The 24 offers
  are made-up sample offers created by the project's `seed_catalogue` command. They are not real offers.
- The **Last checked** dates you see (such as "30 October 2026") are dates that the sample data was given.
  Nobody at Freejoy checked these offers. On the real site, "Last checked" is only ever the date an editor pressed
  **Mark verified** on that offer.
- The destination of every "claim" button in the sample data is a placeholder on `example.com`.
- Numbers in the admin screenshots (users, subscriptions, revenue, audit entries) come from an almost empty test
  database: two test accounts and no paying customers. They are not visitor or revenue figures.
- The admin offers list also contains two entries titled "Guide walkthrough sample (test entry)". They were made
  while writing this guide to show the publish steps, and were archived straight afterwards.
- Email addresses in the screenshots are test addresses on `example.com` or `example.test`. They are not real people.

### How the screenshots were taken

- Public pages: a production build of the Next.js site served locally, reading the sample catalogue from a local
  FastAPI backend and a local test database. The alerts sign-up used the backend's **fake email provider**, which
  writes each email to a file instead of sending it. Nothing was sent to anyone and no other website was opened.
- Desktop images are 1440 pixels wide; phone images are 390 pixels wide. A phone image is only included where the
  layout differs from the desktop one.
- Admin pages: sign-in to the real site goes through Firebase, which needs a Firebase project. This guide was
  written without one. The admin screenshots were taken through the project's documented, test-only identity
  server (see [admin-offers.md](../developer/admin-offers.md#journey-4-playwright)), which accepts only two
  throwaway session values that the developer sets when starting it, on a private test database and seeds one admin and one ordinary user. It is not part of the
  application, and the app has no sign-in shortcut. Screens that need a real Firebase sign-in, a Stripe account or
  two-factor authentication are marked **Screen pending**, with the reason (needs the Firebase test project, or a Stripe test account; both are
  owner actions); they have no picture. No image in this guide is a mock-up.

### The legal and information pages are drafts

The About, Contact, Privacy, Cookie, Terms and Affiliate disclosure pages all carry the banner
"Draft — placeholder text pending legal review" and say "Last reviewed: Not yet reviewed". Do not treat their
wording as final or as legal advice. See [page 5](05-information-pages.md).

### Things that are not built yet

Said plainly so nobody goes looking for them: the Contact form does not send messages; there are no "saved" or
favourite offers; the alerts sign-up only sends a confirmation email today (no alert emails go out yet); the
admin Dashboard and SEO pages are switched off ("Not available yet"); the admin Settings page shows statistics
only; and creating affiliate links is not in the admin screens.

## Developer documentation

This guide describes behaviour. How the code is built is in [docs/developer](../developer/README.md).
