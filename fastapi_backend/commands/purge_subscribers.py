"""Delete alert subscribers whose retention has run out.

    uv run python -m commands.purge_subscribers --dry-run    # count only, change nothing
    uv run python -m commands.purge_subscribers              # delete

Run by hand (nothing schedules it). It removes

* PENDING sign-ups whose consent is older than 30 days (nobody ever confirmed), and
* UNSUBSCRIBED rows whose unsubscribe is older than 12 months (the suppression record is no longer needed).

CONFIRMED rows are never touched. For each row that has a provider contact the command first erases the
contact at the provider; if that fails the row is kept and tried again on the next run, so a contact is never
orphaned at the provider with no row pointing to it. Output is counts only, never addresses.
