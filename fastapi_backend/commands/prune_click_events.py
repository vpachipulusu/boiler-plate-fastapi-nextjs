"""Delete old outbound click events.

    uv run python -m commands.prune_click_events            # keep 395 days (13 months)
    uv run python -m commands.prune_click_events --days 90 --batch-size 5000

Deletes every ``click_events`` row whose ``occurred_at`` is older than ``--days`` days and prints how many
went. It deletes in batches of ``--batch-size`` rows (default 10000), committing after each batch, so a
large backlog never holds one huge transaction; if it fails part-way the earlier batches stay deleted and
the error message says how many. ``occurred_at`` is already truncated to the minute, so the cutoff is exact
to the minute. The retention period and the reasoning are in ``docs/developer/freejoy-affiliate.md``; the
privacy page states the same period, so change both together.

Run it on a schedule (for example monthly). It uses ``DATABASE_URL`` and is safe to repeat.
