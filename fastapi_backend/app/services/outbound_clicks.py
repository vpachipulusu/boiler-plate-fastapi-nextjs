"""The outbound click: decide whether a visitor may be sent to the provider, and count it once.

Rules, in order:

1. The offer must be public by the same rule as the catalogue API (``CatalogueService``): an
   unknown, draft, archived, never-live, hidden-category or inactive-merchant offer is ``None``
   (the caller answers 404); an offer that was public and has ended is an ``ExpiredOffer`` (410).
   Neither writes a click.
2. The offer needs an active affiliate link whose stored destination is a clean https URL
   (``validate_https_url``, re-checked here because rows can be written outside the admin API)
   on a host its provider is allowed to use (``affiliate_hosts``). Links that fail are skipped;
   if none is left the answer is ``None`` and no click is written.
3. Exactly one click event is written and committed, then the destination is returned.

Nothing here logs a destination URL: logs carry link ids and a reason code only.
