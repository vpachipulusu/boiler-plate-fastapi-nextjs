"""Validation of the URLs an editor stores in the catalogue.

Affiliate destinations, offer source links, merchant websites and logos are written by admins
and later followed by visitors (the redirect story). A bad value is an open redirect or a
script injection, so the rules are strict and deliberately simple. A URL is accepted only if:

* it is a string of at most ``MAX_URL_LENGTH`` ASCII characters with no whitespace, control or
  format characters, no backslash and no percent-encoded control character (``%0d%0a`` could
  split a ``Location`` header);
* the scheme is exactly ``https`` (so ``javascript:``, ``data:``, ``http:`` and scheme-relative
  ``//host`` forms fail), and ``https:host`` or ``https:///host`` (no authority) fail;
* the authority has no user info (``https://trusted.example@evil.example`` fails), no IPv6
  literal and no port other than 443;
* the host is a DNS name with at least two labels of letters, digits and inner hyphens, and the
  last label is not a number (decimal digits, or ``0x`` followed by hex digits, the WHATWG
  "ends in a number" rule). That refuses IPv4 in every spelling browsers and glibc accept
  (``127.0.0.1``, ``2130706433``, ``0x7f.0.0.0x1``, ``1.0x``) and single-label names such as
  ``localhost``.

The validator looks at the text only. It cannot stop a name that resolves to a private address
(``localhost.localdomain``, ``127.0.0.1.nip.io``). Any future server-side fetcher of these URLs
must resolve the host and refuse private, loopback and link-local addresses at connect time,
and must refuse redirects to anything but https.

Non-ASCII hosts must be given in punycode. The scheme and host are returned lower-cased; the
path, query and fragment are kept byte for byte.
